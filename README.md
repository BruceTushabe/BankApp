# BankApp
This is a practice project of a web-based banking app that allows you to do everything a bank would allow you to do in a typical transaction.

One should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as the user desires. 
There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdraws if the balance is sufficient. 
There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.

There can be multiple improvements for this project, including adding support for multiple types of accounts. 
For example, there can be a recurring deposit account that should not allow withdrawals till the maturation date, and th
e amount is automatically added to the account post the maturation date. 

I did this project because it is still one of the most popular java projects for beginners.

I welcome any review or additions.
